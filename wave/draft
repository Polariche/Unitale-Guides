- New to Lua?

Unitale uses Lua(http://www.lua.org/), which is often used for modding. If you have some coding experience,
getting into Lua shouldn't be too hard.

Programming knowledge is vital to creating a good Unitale battle. If you haven't programmed anything before,
I recommend learning the basics. Below are some good sites for doing that.
